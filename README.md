**THIS MODLIST IS NOT INSTALLABLE ATM**




## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## Afterword

I must applaud you if you have read the entire README. I started with this modlist in December 2019 and thought about it as early as November I think. When creating this modlist my main goal was to have a NSFW poster boy for Wabbajack and introduce + convince people from other communities to try out Wabbajack. There are still a ton of people who have no idea what Wabbajack does and still associate the word "modpack" with it. I also wanted to show users and modlist authors some good practices when creating a modlist and actually publishing it, this is not about the actual modlist itself but everything around it such as a README, Changelog, how to contribute, releases and so on.

The READMEs of other modlists are mostly written on GDocs and only contain information on how to install the thing and how to setup the MCM. This is fine if you have something like [SME(FT)](https://github.com/EzioTheDeadPoet/SME-FT-) which is a small little starting point but not if you have a massive modlist with 800+ mods, 100+GB downloads and 90% of your README is MCM. My vision for a good modlist README is reflected here and you already read it. It should contain information on the general idea, why you would wanna install it, what you need but most importantly: what you actually get and what are the most important mods you should know about.

I hope we will get more READMEs like this in the future so that the user has a better experience and asks less questions. Other modlists authors often complain about "stupid users" with "stupid questions" even tho their own README has like 20 lines on how to install it. It might also be that NSFW users are simply superior to plebs but I rarely get stupid questions since you can just pop up this README and likely find the information you need.
Special Thanks to the WJ Team and Halgari!
